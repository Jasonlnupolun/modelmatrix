## Where to get it

Model Matrix workflow focused around [command line interface](http://collectivemedia.github.io/modelmatrix/doc/cli.html), 
however you can use client library to apply model matrix transformations to DataFrame in your application.

To get the latest version of the model matrix, add the following to your SBT build:

``` scala
resolvers += "Collective Media Bintray" at "https://dl.bintray.com/collectivemedia/releases"
```

And use following library dependencies:

```
libraryDependencies +=  "com.collective.modelmatrix" %% "modelmatrix-client" % "0.0.1"
```

## Developing

Local PostgreSQL database required for integration tests

#### Default PostrgeSQL database config

    url      = "jdbc:postgresql://localhost/modelmatrix"  
    user     = "modelmatrix"  
    password = "modelmatrix"  

#### Install schema

Schema migrations managed by [Flyway](http://flywaydb.org), 
schema DDL and migrations located in: `modelmatrix-core/src/main/resources/db/migration`

Install schema for development:

    sbt> project modelmatrix-core  
    sbt> flywayMigrate 
    
If you need to install schema into different database, you have to provide flyway properties at sbt startup

    sbt -Dflyway.url=myUrl \
        -Dflyway.user=myUser \
        -Dflyway.password=mySecretPwd \
        -Dflyway.schemas=schema1,schema2,schema3 \
        -Dflyway.placeholders.keyABC=valueXYZ \
        -Dflyway.placeholders.otherplaceholder=value123

## Testing

All tests that require Spark or Postgres are running as a part of integration tests

    sbt test
    sbt it:test
    
## Assembling CLI jar

To run CLI you need to assembly application jar first

    sbt assembly        

## Git Workflow

This repository workflow is based on [A successful Git branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) with two main branches with an infinite lifetime:

* master
* develop

The **master** branch at origin should be familiar to every Git user. Parallel to the master branch, another branch exists called **develop**.

We consider **origin/master** to be the main branch where the source code of HEAD always reflects a production-ready state.

We consider **origin/develop** to be the main branch where the source code of HEAD always reflects a state with the latest delivered development changes for the next release. Some would call this the “integration branch”. This is where any automatic nightly builds are built from.

Further details are available in [A successful Git branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) blog post.
